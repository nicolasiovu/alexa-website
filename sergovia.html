        What I would call our first ever date spot, Sergovia 
        brought many great memories to me. I remember
        the first time we went here, I was so nervous,
        but everything still went so well. I realized that
        I'd never connected quite so well with anyone,
        and that you were truly someone who would become
        special to me. The lighting in this shop tended
        to be just perfect, and I found myself especially 
        entranced by your beautiful eyes here. I was so proud 
        and amazed at what a gorgeous woman sat across
        the table.
