        I believe now is a good time to address this big 
        penguin that has entered my life mysteriously.
        Merlin "Merlino" Rigonan is only a few months old,
        and is the son of an unknown Antarctic married
        Gentoo penguin couple. Unfortunately, they perished
        and were unable to take care of their child. An animal
        rescue company known as Miniso set up an adoption centre
        for the rescued wildlife. Thankfully, this lady known
        as Alexa came along and adopted him. And now he is
        a son to me as well. As we see in this image, his
        mother loves him very much.
