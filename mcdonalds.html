        I know it may not seem like a big deal at all,
        but I very much enjoyed going to McDonald's with you.
        The satisfying food, the conversation, the longer commute there
        and back to the terminal. It was the perfect package for 
        a fun afternoon. I took this picture because of how
        elegant you look in that trench coat. What a sophisticated
        lady this is, I thought to myself. The way you dress, even 
        if it's just around a school uniform, never ceases to amaze me.
        Not to mention how good your hair always looks. Anyway, I'm 
        getting carried away. McDonald's was a fun time!
