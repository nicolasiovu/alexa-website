        A rather joyous occasion, especially for me,
        as I saw you walk along that stage to 
        receive your well deserved award. I was so 
        torn between filming when you went up, or clapping
        and cheering with all my might. I chose the latter.
        Thankfully, my parents got the videos, so I got the 
        best of both worlds! I'm happy you liked the flowers, too. 
        Although this day marked the last time I knew
        for sure I'd see you, which was a little nerve racking,
        it was still an occasion to celebrate. It all worked out
        perfectly, too. For your academic achievements, I'm so proud 
        of you. You worked so hard for all that you've attained,
        and I'm happy to see them come to fruition now. You
        have only success in your future, I can tell that much.
