        The ring that served to solidify in your mind that 
        I truly love you dearly. There could be
        no mistake, with only a heart shaped
        crystal upon the band. I was so happy to see you 
        wearing it every day. I still remember the time
        we first slipped it onto your finger in the 
        mall. I was thrilled! Walking with you that day
        around Sqaure One was one of the most joyous times of my
        life. You could imagine how proud I was to walk 
        around that place with the most beautiful lady 
        by my side.
