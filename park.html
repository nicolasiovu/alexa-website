        This bench at the park was the venue for 
        some afternoons I certainly will never
        forget. The warm sun, the wondeful scenery, nature
        all around. It all felt so comforting, only it became
        so much more comforting with you by my side. 
        No matter what happened in school that day,
        coming to this bench with you made it one of the 
        best days I can remember. Spending time with you 
        is my favourite activity. This park helped me realize that
        even more. The peonies in the background, they reminded me
        of the ones I had given you. I loved those flowers. 
        I think they were the perfect choice. They do remind me of you
        in a way, you know. The prettiest and best smelling flowers
        I've ever known.
