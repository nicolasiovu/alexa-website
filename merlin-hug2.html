        We now see the modern day Merlin in his natural
        habitat, in the bed of this wonderful lady. Note
        the giant smile on both of their faces. Do not note 
        the fact that Merlin cannot physically change 
        his facial expression. He is happy, I assure you. 
        Used as a pillow, Merlin's muscular frame comes in handy.
        We see here as his torso is being compressed under the weight of
        the lady's head, which contains a massive brain, necessary to
        contain such intelligence of course. A little known fact about 
        penguins rescued by Miniso: their muscle tissue turns incredibly soft,
        to the point of squishiness, as seen here. No, he is not just fat.
        He's also big boned.
