        How wonderful it was to sit with you in church.
        I truly felt like a married man, sat next 
        to my wife for Sunday mass. Well, it'll be like
        that one day for real. I can't exactly remember who took
        this picture, but they deserve many thanks indeed. I love
        this picture! And we spent the whole day together, at
        the grad brunch after church and then BCC afterwards.
        How wonderful it was to see you all dressed up too. 
        You looked gorgeous as usual, needless to say. You 
        already know how much I like flowery dresses. 
        Anyway, you made me so happy that day.
