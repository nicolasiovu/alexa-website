        This lunchtable is where it all began after all.
        From simply observing, seeing how incredibly
        beautiful and intelligent you are, wishing you
        were the one I could call my lady, to one day  
        sitting by your side every day, enjoying the 
        lunch time together. Here we had many fun times, 
        joking conversations, and unforgettable smiles, as seen here.
        In fact, it was in the great hall on that Christmas
        Civvies day that made me realize the magnitude of
        the attraction I felt towards you. What started off as a slight
        feeling grew immensely as I talked to you briefly that morning.
        A silly conversation, but it meant so much to me. And you 
        can be sure it's all I thought about that day.
