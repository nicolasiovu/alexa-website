        The place which held a few joyful times
        of exam study, only made so wonderful by you,
        of course. I very much enjoyed being able to look
        across the table and see such an adorable lady.
        I saw first hand how dedicated you are to your work,
        how efficiently you handled your studies.
        Despite the silence of the library, it felt
        that our eyes did the talking the whole time
        and that conversation never bored. I remember taking
        this picture because I noticed how cute you looked.
