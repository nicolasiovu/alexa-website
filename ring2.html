        Here is the ring which you have 
        so graciously gifted me. I wear it every single day without
        fail. I love being able to look down at my hand
        and have a constant reminder of the lovely 
        lady which I have the pleasure of knowing.
        I remember when you told me you got me a ring,
        I was so thrilled, I was dying with anticipation.
        And when I finally slipped it onto my finger,
        it felt amazing. This is a permanent gift, you see. I 
        plan to wear this ring for the rest of my life. Even if
        a wedding band appears on my hand alongside it,
        this ring will remain even still. It is forever a reminder of
        your love.
